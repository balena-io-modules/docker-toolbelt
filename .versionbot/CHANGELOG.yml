      body: >
        This commit uses typedoc to generate documentation from source code.

        It also adds a small GitHub action that will build and publish the docs

        to the `docs` branch after a version bump, so that they can be served
        from

        GitHub pages.

        Breaking changes:

        - aufsdiffpaths now deprecate, use diffPaths instead

        - Minimum node version is 12

        - Resolves native promises instead of Bluebird

        - Switch to non-bluebird disposer pattern, to maintain native promise
        interface, use "withImageRootDirMounted" instead of
        "imagerootdirmounted"

        We add an additional "digest" field to the object returned by
        getRegistryAndName, which is populated  with the digest

        when the image has digest instead of tag. Otherwise behavior us the same
        as before.

        compileRegistryAndName now accepts a digest field too.

        normaliseImageName worked with digests but it was just lucky, as
        getRegistryAndName would match the "@sha256" as part of the repo.

        This change makes the support intentional, and matching the image name
        in the correct way.

        We did try to handle cases where the opts passed to mount exceeded page size by passing relative paths to mount. This apparently doesn’t always work. With this commit, we now read each layer’s `link` file that contains the name of its alias under `/var/lib/docker/overlay2/l` directory, which makes for a very short path name.
        For example the diff directory `/var/lib/docker/overlay2/223c2864175491657d238e2664251df13b63adb8d050924fd1bfcdb278b866f7/diff` now is referenced as `l/NFYKDW6APBCCUCTOUSYDH4DXAT`, which is much shorter.

        This module used to promisify and mutate the Docker class from
        dockerode, which is bad.

        It also mutated images and containers by promisifying their prototype.

        Now we extend that class and use dockerode's promise support instead of
        promisifying - but we pass bluebird

        as the Promise for dockerode to use.

        We also add mocha (with mochainon) and some basic tests that only cover
        testing that this returns a valid promise-aware

        docker object.

        No tests for the docker-toolbelt specific functions were added yet
        (should be added soon, hopefully...).

        The overlay2 driver adds support for more than one “lower” layer (quite
        similar to aufs) and changed how an OverlayFS is represented on disk.
        This commit adds support for inspecting the “diff” layer and mounting an
        fs created with overlay2.

        This deprecates `aufsDiffPaths`, which now also applies to overlay2,
        introducing a new method `diffPaths` that can work with both aufs and
        overlay2.

        mount limits the mount options to page size (usually 4096 bytes), so we do what docker does
        to mount when layers don't fit in that: we mount with as much as we can fit and then
        remount appending each remaining layer. We stick to 4096 instead of actually finding the page size
        cause it's assured to work (4096 is the minimum in the arches we support), reduces complexity and
        shouldn't generate much overhead (we don't care about a few extra remounts).
        Based on https://github.com/docker/docker/blob/b937aa8e6968d805527d163e6f477d496ceb88d7/daemon/graphdriver/aufs/aufs.go#L595
        We also introduce 8 random characters to the temporary path we use for the aufs mount, so that
        several calls to this function can work independently.

        imageRootDir now works for aufs, but shows only the last diff in the
        image.

        To have fully compatible behavior, imageRootDirMounted should be used,
        so that

        the full image rootfs gets mounted at the returned path. For other
        drivers,

        behavior will be the same as imageRootDir (only it has to be used with
        Promise.using).

        aufsDiffPaths allows getting the paths for each layer diff in an
        aufs-stored image.
