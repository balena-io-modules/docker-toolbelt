# Docker Toolbelt

A belt full of tools for working with Docker.

Docker Toolbelt provide utilities to work with Docker's layer store and it leverages [dockerode](https://github.com/apocas/dockerode) to implement a few conveniences. This module also supports [balenaEngine](https://github.com/balena-os/balena-engine), notably its [delta generation feature](https://www.balena.io/engine/docs/#Container-deltas).

## Installation

Install `docker-toolbelt` by running:

```sh
$ npm install --save docker-toolbelt
```

`dockerode` is a peer dependency that must be satisfied explicitly.
